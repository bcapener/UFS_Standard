# 1 SCOPE

This standard specifies the characteristics of the UFS electrical interface and the memory device. Such
characteristics include (among others) low power consumption, high data throughput, low
electromagnetic interference and optimization for mass memory subsystem efficiency. The UFS electrical
interface is based on an advanced differential interface by MIPI M-PHY standard which together with the
MIPI UniPro standard forms the interconnect of the UFS interface. The architectural model is referencing
the INCITS T10 (SCSI) SAM standard and the command protocol is based on INCITS T10 (SCSI) SPC
and SBC standards.
